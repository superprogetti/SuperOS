# SuperOS
SuperOS is an new enhanced  remix operating system based on Ubuntu LTS | GNU/Linux. It’s suitable only for 64bit desktop/mobile workstations. It inherits many features and functions and it supports tons of linux based applications also. You can use it freely in any environment – home, office, education or any other. We used it normally for our design projects. With SuperOS you will have a portable tiny and super-fast environment. The .iso image it’s only 800MB with only the basic system. For others apps, you can download selected Appimages, storable in *any* filesystem (fat32 also). Obviusly you can also install normally with “apt-get install” like any other ubuntu distibution.
